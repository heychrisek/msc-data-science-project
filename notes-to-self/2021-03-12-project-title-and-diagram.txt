          category = Wiki Software System, DB, Programming Language
          article = dev.to article
      
      - intend to do same with Reuters XML documents

          article = Reuters XML


    Abstract / Objectives

      This project is intended to generate a knowledge graph of news articles. The knowledge graph will link news items with their categories, subjects, and related news items. This will be accomplished by applying techniques including:
        - ingestion of XML documents into a graph database
        - establishment of relationships between each news item node and its categories
        - link prediction to generate new relationships
        - NLP entity extraction
        - linked data with Wikidata
        - ontology review/development (Wikidata geography + other entity ontologies)

      

    ** CALL db.schema.visualization()
    Schema (Subject == Genre == Category ?)

      x NewsItem            :HAS_GENRE      Genre
      

      NewsItem                  :HAS_SUBJECT    Subject
      NewsItem                  :HAS_ENTITY     WikipediaPage (Entity?)
      WikipediaPage (Entity?)   :ABOUT          Category
      Category                  :SUB_CAT_OF     Category

      WikipediaPage and Category are both Resource


    ignore Genre -- only relevant for Reuters, not knowledge graph overall
