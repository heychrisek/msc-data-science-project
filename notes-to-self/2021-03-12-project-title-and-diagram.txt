    "pipeline"
        data prep
          XML docs

          iterate and parse XML docs
            (parsing depends on XML format)

          build up CSV of all data

        Neo4j ingest
          sample rows from CSV (some number, only Breakingviews)
          
          build up Neo4j DB of all data


PROJECT PROPOSAL...
    project proposal
      - show POC with Neo4j tutorial
          category = Wiki Software System, DB, Programming Language
          article = dev.to article
      
      - intend to do same with Reuters XML documents
          category = Wiki ... (famous people, financial orgs, countries, cities, political orgs)
          article = Reuters XML
