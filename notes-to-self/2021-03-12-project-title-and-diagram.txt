project proposal
  - show POC with Neo4j tutorial
      category = Wiki Software System, DB, Programming Language
      article = dev.to article
  
  - intend to do same with Reuters XML documents
      category = Wiki ... (famous people, financial orgs, countries, cities, political orgs)
      article = Reuters XML



application/evaluation
  - number of related NewsItems
  - quality of related NewsItems
  - number of facts
  - quality of facts
