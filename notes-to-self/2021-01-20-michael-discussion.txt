question #1
  
  two problems as different: 

    first problem
      what do I want to achieve
      fixed amount of time, it will be hard, time is limited
      progress may not be as fast as I hoped

      set up some minimal problem that I can achieve AND a more challenging one
    
    second problem (converge search/recommendation/ads) is very challenging -- if I can do something that really works, I can make a lot of money

  The process is as follows:
  1.) Upload some documents (plain .txt files)
  2.) Do a bit of annotation to help tailor the results to your domain. This is done by clicking on a word and selecting a tag from the menu.
  3.) Hit the launch icon, and wait for a bit (depends on size and quantity of documents)
  4.) When done, click on the results icon to view and download.
  We also have a python wrapper if you want to interface with it through code.
