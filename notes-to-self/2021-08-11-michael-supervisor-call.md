  ***NEO4J***



Questions for Michael
1. Do you have any general feedback on the project or demo?
2. Besides the project report, are there any other requirements to prepare for? (for example is a scripted demo of the knowledge graph required, should code appear in appendix / Github?)

specific questions:
  - overall feedback
  - where to put code
  - where to focus?
      similarity algorithms
      centrality algorithms
      link prediction algorithms

      evaluation
        precision/recall
        interpretability
        compare similarity metrics

        **how to evaluate a knowledge graph?**
        **how to evaluate information retrieval?**
          
          (we can retrieve information we couldn't before)
