"A Common Sense View of Knowledge Graphs"


Knowledge Graph
  knowledge = justified, true belief (JTB), information sufficiently believed to be acted upon (Charles Peirce)
  graph = nodes/vertices connected by edges
          directed and labeled graph
          "directed (mostly acyclic) graph (or DAG)"


KG citations booming in the last 10 years (spike in 2012)

"...all of us who were advocates and practitioners well knew that the idea of an ontology was difficult to explain to others. The term seemed to have both technical and abstract connotations and, when first introduced, always required some discussion and definition. The notion of a knowledge graph, on the other hand, is both descriptive and intuitive."

"The semantic Web community had been split for some time between two camps"
  - One camp saw the need for formal ontologies and were often likely to use the OWL language, at least for formal conceptual schemas.
  - Another camp leaned more to diversity and decentralized approaches to vocabularies, and tended to prefer RDF (and, later, linked data). 
"The idea of a ‘knowledge graph’ was able to sidestep these differences and provide a common terminology for both camps. I think each camp embraced the term, in part, for these different reasons. Both camps, however, seemed to share the view that the term ‘knowledge graph’ offered some strong marketing advantages, not least of which was the implicit endorsement of Google."


"Knowledge Graphs: What They Are Not"

- Provenance is not required (but believability of the information is important)
- Context is useful but not strictly required
- A specific language or data model (RDF, concept graphs, OWL) is not required
- Types or type classification are not required
- Neither instances, nor attributes, nor concepts, nor specific relations are required, but one or two is
- A knowledge graph need not be both machine- and human-readable
- No specific schema or formal logic is required
- Curation is not required (but believability of the information is important)
- A specific scope is not required
- Statements in the knowledge graph need not be triples

** "Because our understanding of KGs remains somewhat vague, we should ask and expect authors of KGs to define the scope and basis of the knowledge used in their graphs." **


"KGs are not much different than ontologies, with a similarly broad and contextual use. Indeed, in the words of Ehrlinger and Wöß [9], “Graph-based knowledge representation has been researched for decades and the term knowledge graph does not constitute a new technology. Rather, it is a buzzword reinvented by Google and adopted by other companies and academia to describe different knowledge representation applications.”"


KBpedia: "we tend to define knowledge graphs as complete knowledge bases of concepts and instances and their attributes, coherently organized into types and a logical and computable graph, and written in RDF, SKOS, and OWL"
