"News Graph: An Enhanced Knowledge Graph for News Recommendation"


"In this paper, we consider the scenario of news recommendations. We observe that both collaborative relations ofentities (e.g.,entities frequently appear in same news articles orclicked by same users) and the topic context of news article can bewell utilized to construct a more powerful graph for news recom-mendations. Thus we propose an enhanced knowledge graph callednews graph. Compared with a generic knowledge graph, the newsgraph is enhanced from three aspects: (1) adding a new group of entities for recording topic context information; (2) adding collaborative edges between entities based on users’ click behaviors and co-occurrence in news articles; and (3) removing news-irrelevant relations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a domain specific graph is constructed for news recommendations"

"...previous graph based studies indiscriminately utilize the KG entities [17,26],while ignore the fact that some entities and relations in a generic KG may contain irrelevant information for news recommendations.e.g., The birthday of Donald Trump is an uninformative relation for news recommendations and including it may even result in the inefficiency problem."

"collaborative edges are extracted in three ways: (1) co-occurrence in the same news; (2) clicked by the same user;and (3) clicked by the same user in the same browsing session. Dueto the selection of news-relevant relations and enhancement ofcollaborative information, the resultingnews graphsis expected topossess a stronger capacity of representing news articles and users’reading behaviors, thus it is news domain-oriented"
