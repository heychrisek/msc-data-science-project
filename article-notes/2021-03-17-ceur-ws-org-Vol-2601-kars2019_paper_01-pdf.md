"News Graph: An Enhanced Knowledge Graph for NewsRecommendation"


"In this paper, we consider the scenario of newsrecommendations. We observe that both collaborative relations ofentities (e.g.,entities frequently appear in same news articles orclicked by same users) and the topic context of news article can bewell utilized to construct a more powerful graph for news recom-mendations. Thus we propose an enhanced knowledge graph callednews graph. Compared with a generic knowledge graph, the newsgraph is enhanced from three aspects: (1) adding a new group ofentities for recording topic context information; (2) adding collabo-rative edges between entities based on usersâ€™ click behaviors andco-occurrence in news articles; and (3) removing news-irrelevantrelations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that adomain specific graph is constructed for news recommendations"
