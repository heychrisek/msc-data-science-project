"Statistical Relational Learning"

"Five Machine Learning Paradigms"

1. Connectionists, Geoffrey Hinton (University of Toronto, Google, Deep Learning): A learning algorithm should mimic the brain. Neuroscience.
2. Evolutionists, John Holland (University of Michigan): Not the brain but evolution as master algorithm. Currently building 3D prints of future robots.
3. Analogists, Douglas R. Hofstadter (writer, "Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid"): analogy is the core of cognition. Philosophy.
4. Symbolists, Stephen Muggleton (Imperial College London): psychology is the base, develop rules in deductive reasoning. Adam, robot scientist at the University of Manchester.
5. Statistics & Logic, Bayesian networks, Judea Pearl (UCLA, Turing Award): Bayesians think everything can be represented by the Bayes theorem using hypotheses that can update based on new evidence

#5 corresponds to SRL (see [my notes on another article](https://github.com/heychrisek/msc-data-science-project/blob/main/article-notes/https-arxiv-org-pdf-1503-00759.txt))

Markov Logic Networks (MLN)

- Pedro Domingos (University of Washington), introduced MLN in 2006. Alchemy first order logic tool.
– Luc De Raedt (AI group at University of Leuven), created ProbLog (with Python wrapper).
- Christopher Ré (HAZY Project, InfoLab, Stanford University). Tuffy, Felix, Elementary, Deep Dive tools
- Michael Beetz (TU Munich, TU Bremen). ProbCog.
- Volker Tresp (Ludwig Maximilians University), Matthias Nickles (Technical University of Munich).
