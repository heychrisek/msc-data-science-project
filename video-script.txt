INTRO
high level: 
  
  from proposal:
  ** can we build a NewsML to Knowledge Graph pipeline, resulting in a knowledge graph that improves news item recommendations and information retrieval?**

  the answer is yes:
  
  -> news dataset
    -> XML
      -> scripts
        -> neo4j
          -> SPARQL for linked data (Wikidata)
          -> NLP for entity extraction

  in short, CONVERT:
    Reuters news archive from AWS S3
    https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-qwmkdffmmjesa
  INTO
    an actionable knowledge graph,
      in the form of a Neo4j graph database
      which can be queried by Cypher query language

    for example:
      `* 01 ...`
      UK-> colonial power -> other colonial powers like Denmark -> guid -> similar guid recommendation


  how does path query work?
    `* 02 n->w->c1->c2`


  that's the high-level intro
  from here, we'll go into:
    (1) how this was built, how the pipeline works and how we did semantic enhancement, and
    (2) other useful applications for journalists and researchers


1 HOW IT WAS BUILT

    areas where it can be de-coupled

  SPARQL and linked data

  NLP entity extraction

2 OTHER USEFUL APPLICATIONS

  shortest path...

  journalist research...

  football, austria, others? (EXPLORE!)


CONCLUSION

  exhibited how a domain-specific knowledge graph is viable in the news domain
  how it's useful for journalists and researchers

  for future consideration, how to apply algorithms, etc.
  improve linked data, which skews heavily towards geography
