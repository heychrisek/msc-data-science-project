      NOTES FROM MICHAEL
          question:
            corpus of XML about champions league football -- how does this import into Neo4j 
            explain mapping of news XML to neo4j, how would it be different for a different corpus

          todo:        
            indicate some possibilities of future research (similarity, algorithms, etc)
            indicate what can be done, give examples

            end research paper with outlook/conclusions/future work

            demo in September

            structure of report:
                abstract: this project is about this and that, aim is ..., general terms about research problem, why people are interested
                (check if I'm interested at all)

                intro
                (why this is interesting and that I'm great; you're an idiot to not buy my product; sell story)
                  
                  summary -> "research problem", media area
                    i/o
                    use cases
                  background
                  aims and objectives

                  technologies used to solve problem

      future work
          similarity algorithms: https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/similarity/
          centrality algorithms: https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/centrality/
          link prediction algorithms: https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/linkprediction/

      evaluation
        precision/recall
        interpretability

        compare similarity
          different algorithms (Jaccard, etc.)
          different shared properties (subjects/genres/entities)

        information retrieval: can retrieve information we couldn't before

      write up sections from "MSc Data Science project marking criteria" on Moodle
      for a distinction:
        "Project Report:
                • Specification and design: The specification and design of the system/software shows a clear understanding of what needs to be done to meet the requirements, and is well-rounded, i.e. the components fit together in a coherent way. 
                • Implementation, or execution of research: The key stages of the implementation/research are clearly explained. The implementation/research is done to a high standard.
                • Testing, results, analysis and critical evaluation: The solution demonstrates real insight into the problem/research question. There is clear and justified reflection upon the contribution and its limitations. The key results are accurately analysed and their relevance is explained. It is discussed how the software meets the specified requirements and is shown to be reliable. The author critically assesses the results and draws relevant conclusions from the study. A running version of the software is demonstrated (as above).
                • Presentation of the proposal/report and documentation: Complex issues are explained clearly and concisely. The content is well-organised and structured in a way that demonstrates the links between the concepts presented. The proposal/report shows that the student clearly understands the researched material. The solution and any other claims made by the students are well-justified. The author uses various resources and cites relevant resources using an appropriate consistent referencing style. The proposal/report is of professional quality and contains very few, ideally no, typographic errors.

      review feedback
        First marker's comments:
        The background research section is very solid and detailed. The student has already taken first practical steps in order to investigate feasibility of this project. Maybe what’s missing in this section is a concrete (possibly imaginary) example of how the resulting system is supposed to work. The proposal contains a section with the project aims and objectives. It is not perfectly written, but the author’s intentions are clear. The project plan and methodology look detailed. Whether it can be followed successfully depends on many parameters, as the author mentions in Section 4.3. The proposal is well written in general. It would be even better without a few typos and little imperfections such as Latex quotation marks.

        Second marker's comments:
        The main aim is to build a system for news retrieval and recommendation using knowledge graph techniques. Many different technologies are proposed for use in developing a solution, probably too many. Recommendations are usually based on some knowledge of user preferences, but there is no mention of how these will be captured or used. Perhaps it is expected to be more about retrieval than recommendation. An extensive list of news sources has been identified. It is commendable that a proof-of-concept system has already been built. I would have thought that a full(er) literature review would have been done in preparation for the proposal. The project is ambitious, but the potential risks have been recognised. The timeline could have provided greater detail. The proposal is very well written, with a good number of references.
